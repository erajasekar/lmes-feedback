*** Can just having practical underdanding of knowledge create Entrepreneurs and Scientists? ***

> Let’s say student’s has good practical knowledge of how computers work. Is that sufficient for them to invent a smart phone..?

## What is School For ?

*** Are we asking our kids to collect the dots or connect the dots ? ***

---

** Collect the dots **

* Today’s school system teaches students only to collect the dots. i.e collect knowledge.
* Because education system is created for industrial age. Because knowledge is scarce. So we are thought to collect the dots, scored based on how many dots you have collected.
* But school teach nothing about how to connect those dots.
* We can’t teach connecting dots in a text book.

---

** Connect the dots **

* This is before we had super computer in our packet . The current system is created for world with no wikipedia, no google or internet.
* In new technological age, all the information is just a click away.
* In future, most of the manual “factory work” will be replaced by machines.
* So to succeed in future jobs. Students should know how to connect the dots. As Steve Jobs has said:


>  Creativity is just connecting things -- Steve Jobs

### How schools can teach students to collect the dots and at the same time ensuring that they collect enough dots pass the test?

* People who are happy and successful are not there because they know more stuff or got good grades.
* They have access to information they need and desire to get it.
* They also have to insight and intuition to connect disparate streams of information and turn it in to whole new way of thinking.

---

### We should stop teaching collecting the dots

Instead we need to teach
* Intention to learn.
* How to go get it?

---

### What LMES is doing is great job creating “Intention to learn”

* Making learning fun and interesting
* Creating curiosity in students to learn.
* Get practical understanding of knowledge.

This will help students to perform good in their Job as employee. But if we want to create entrepreneurs who can create products or scientists who invent stuff, we also need to teach them to connect dots.


### Few ideas for LMES

** Don’t simply teach the solution, but fundamental problem solving skills **

* First show wrong way to do it, then how to get insights from it to arrive at correct answer.
* Encourage students to try something, make mistakes and learn from it.
* When learning step by step solution to a mathematics problem, most students just memorize the steps. They should learn how to figure out next step by themselves at teach stage.

---

** Teaching the process to solve the problem is import that teaching the solution itself **

** Teach history of Invention **

*How Archimedes calculated approximate value of `π` 2000 years before ?*

** Teach how to learn **

* Just in case vs Just in time learning *

#### Give opportunity for students to figure out
* In videos, introduce the problem and leave some pause to give a chance for students to figure out themselves.
* Create a teaser video of a problem and show solution in the next video.

> LMES already doing great job to help students to learn practical knowledge. They have more than 5 lakh followers. They work with schools, colleges and conduct workshops. I just want to pass this idea of “connecting dots” more important that “collecting dots” for future jobs. So when creating content, if LMES can also include problem solving skills or tricks to connect the dots, it can really help create entrepreneurs and scientists.
