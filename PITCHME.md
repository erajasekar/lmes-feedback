*** Is just teaching practical underdanding of knowledge enough to Entrepreneurs and Scientists? ***

---

> Let’s say student’s has good practical knowledge of how computers work. Is that sufficient for them to invent a smart phone..?

*** Are we asking our kids to collect the dots or connect the dots ? ***

---

*** Collect the dots ***

* Today’s school system teaches students only to collect the dots. i.e teach knowledge.
* In old age knowledge is scarce. So industrial age introduced educational system to create factory workers.
* So we are thought to collect the dots, scored based on how many dots you have collected.
* But school teach nothing about how to connect those dots.
* We can’t teach connecting dots in a text book.

---

*** Connect the dots ***

* The current system is created for world with no wikipedia, no google or internet.
* Before we had super computer in our packet.
* In new technological age, all the information is just a click away.
* In future, most of the manual “factory work” will be replaced by machines.
* Students should know how to connect the dots to succeed in future jobs.

** As Steve Jobs has said: **

>  Creativity is just connecting things 

E.g Uber

*** How schools can teach students to collect the dots and at the same time ensuring that they collect enough dots pass the test? ***

* People who are happy and successful are not there because they know more stuff or got good grades.
* They have access to information they need and desire to get it.
* They also have to insight and intuition to connect disparate streams of information and turn it in to whole new way of thinking.

### We should stop teaching collecting the dots

> Education is not the learning of facts, but training the mind to think -- Albert Einstien.

Instead we need to teach untention to learn.

---

### LMES does great job in creating “Intention to learn”

* Making learning fun and interesting
* Creating curiosity in students to learn.
* Get practical understanding of knowledge.

---

### To create entrepreneurs and scientists 

we also need to teach - How to connect dots? How to think?

### Few ideas for LMES

** Don’t simply teach the solution, but fundamental problem solving skills **

* First show wrong way to do it, then how to get insights from it to arrive at correct answer.
* Encourage students to try something, make mistakes and learn from it.

---

** Teaching the process to solve the problem is import that teaching the solution itself **

** Teach history of Invention **

*How Archimedes calculated approximate value of `π` 2000 years before ?*

** Teach how to learn **

* Just in case vs Just in time learning *

#### Give opportunity for students to figure out

* In videos, introduce the problem and leave some pause to give a chance for students to figure out themselves.
* Create a teaser video of a problem and show solution in the next video.

> LMES already doing great job to help students to learn practical knowledge. They have more than 5 lakh followers. They work with schools, colleges and conduct workshops. I just want to pass on some ideas for content creation.

So it can benefit lot of students. It can really help create entrepreneurs and scientists.
