I have been following your videos about Ramar Pillai and saw [this recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq_iXullRLw&t=290s) with Nakkheeran Studio in which you talk problems with current school system. I want to share my thoughts about that.

I absolutely agree with you current teaching methods has to be changed for students to get practical understanding of the knowledge. But Is just having practical knowledge is enough for next generation of Jobs..? Here is a question:

> Let’s say student’s has good practical knowledge of how computers work. Is that sufficient for them to invent a smart phone..?

My thoughts are inspired by following Seth Godin’s talk:

[Stop Stealing dreams : Seth Godin at TEDxYouth@BFS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXpbONjV1Jc)
[Connect the dot’s — Questions about Stop Stealing dreams](https://www.akimbo.me/blog/s-3-e-10-connect-the-dotsq-a-about-stop-stealing-dreams)

I would like to paraphrase little bit of what Seth is talking about to provide some context:

Are we asking our kids to collect the dots (get knowledge) or connect the dots (connect knowledge to create ideas) ?

### Collect the dots

* Today’s school system teaches students only to collect the dots. i.e collect knowledge.
* Because education system is created for industrial age. Because knowledge is scarce. So we are thought to collect the dots, scored based on how many dots you have collected.
* But school teach nothing about how to connect those dots.
* We can’t teach connecting dots in a text book.


### Connect the dots
*  This is before we had super computer in our packet . The current system is created for world with no wikipedia, no google or internet.
* In new technological age, all the information is just a click away.
* In future, most of the manual “factory work” will be replaced by machines.
* So to succeed in future jobs. Students should know how to connect the dots. As Steve Jobs has said:

>  Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.

Here is a question from school president about above Seth’s point.

How schools can teach students to collect the dots and at the same time ensuring that they collect enough dots pass the test?

* People who are happy and successful are not there because they know more stuff or got good grades.
* They have access to information they need and desire to get it.
* They also have to insight and intuition to connect disparate streams of information and turn it in to whole new way of thinking.

So we should stop teaching collecting the dots, instead we need to teach
* Intention to learn.
* How to go get it?

What LMES is doing is great first step of creating “Intention to learn” . You are doing a great job in
* Making learning fun and interesting
* Creating curiosity in students to learn.
* Get practical understanding of knowledge.

This will help students to perform good in their Job as employee. But if we want to create entrepreneurs who can create products or scientists who invent stuff, we also need to teach them to connect dots.

It is very hard to teach “connecting dots”, but here are few ideas I can think of:

1. Don’t simply teach the solution, but fundamental problem solving skills
* First show wrong way to do it, then how to get insights from it to arrive at correct answer.
* Encourage students to try something, make mistakes and learn from it.
* Teaching the process to solve the problem is import that teaching the solution itself.

![](Email%20to%20Prem%20anand/prob-solving.png)
* When learning step by step solution to a mathematics problem, most students just memorize the steps. They should learn how to figure out next step by themselves at teach stage.

2. Give opportunity for students to figure out
* In videos, introduce the problem and leave some pause to give a chance for students to figure out themselves. Or
* Create a teaser video of a problem and show solution in the next video.

You are already doing great job to help students to learn practical knowledge. You have more than 5 lakh followers. You work with schools, colleges and conduct workshops. Especially, when I watched your Nakkheeran video, I felt that you have a power to change education for good. You have wonderful wish for india to create entrepreneurs and scientists in India. But you talked about only teaching practical knowledge. So I just want to pass this idea of “connecting dots” more important that “collecting dots” for future jobs. So when creating content, if LMES can also include problem solving skills or tricks to connect the dots, it can really help create entrepreneurs and scientists.

Thank you.
